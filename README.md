A C program to print the current time in UTC, but replace the hour with the military timezone for wherever it is currently noon.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_time_zones.

I also created a javascript/html version so that it can be hosted on a website. Please see my example at https://www.archox.net/Real/projects/coding/clock.html
